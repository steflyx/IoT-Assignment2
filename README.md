# IoT-Assignments

These are some assignments completed for the IoT class at Polimi during the 2019/20 academic year.

They are focused around IoT technologies like *TinyOS*, *Cooja simulator*, *Node-Red* and other related tools (such as *ThingSpeak*) and 
they cover several protocols commonly used in this field, like *MQTT* and *CoaP*.

Each of the folder corresponds to a different assignment and contains an explanation of the problem and of the implemented solutions (assignment 3 is missing as it was theory-only).

As part of the course, we also developed a more complex project inspired to the *Immuni* application - you can find it [here](https://github.com/steflyx/IoT-Project).
